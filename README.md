#### Start Developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd blog
gatsby develop
```


## Deploy to Github Pages

To deploy to github pages, simply do the following:

- Ensure that your `package.json` file correctly reflects where this repo lives
- Change the `pathPrefix` in your `config.js`
- Run the standard deploy command

```sh
npm run deploy
```


#### Access Locally
```
$ git clone https://github.com/[GITHUB_USERNAME]/[REPO_NAME].git
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ yarn
$ npm run develop
```
To test the CMS locally, you'll need run a production build of the site:
```
$ npm run build
$ gatsby serve
```
